# Relatório de Progresso

## Sprint 1

Presentation date: 31/10/2023

### Work done / results

* Read some standards and whitepapers regarding Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and network slicing, as defined by the ETSI, GSMA, 3GPP and 5GPPP organizations.​
* Gathered papers related to NFV and network slicing.​
* Started writing the SoA. ​
* Started experimentating with Openslice, and the features it currently supports.

### Future work / challenges

* Experimenting with OpenSource Management and Orchestration (OSM), which will communicate with Openslice for the provisioning of network slices.​
* Define the software to be used to emulate a 5G core (5GC), for the network slice instantiation.​
* Define the architecture that encompasses the needed final solution, defining the NBIs and SBIs for the communication between Openslice, OSM, and the 5GC, following ETSI standards.
